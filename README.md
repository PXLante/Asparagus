# Rise In Fall
A 5 minute interactive experience for the 2021 GaTech Game Jam

Rise In Fall is a game that addresses the idea that happiness is all around us, in the small things. Often, I struggle with the pace at which the world progresses, and I forget to look around me and see that which I love so so much. 

Rise in Fall originally started as a single improvisation session on my piano. I sat down and thought through three different phases in my thoughts. One was melancholy, one was sad, and one was happy. I find my thoughts are easy to drift any one way so quickly, so I figured I could show these ideas through an interactive art piece. It has been a while since I've created something entirely by myself, and I feel in finally doing so, this art piece is in a lot of ways, me. I hope you enjoy. 

Feel free to play the game for free [right here](https://kekkekin.itch.io/riseinfall)
